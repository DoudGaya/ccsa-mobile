# Android APK Fix Summary 🎯

## Problem
- APK was crashing immediately when opened on Android emulator/device
- Root cause: React Native 0.79.5 required React 19, causing runtime instability

## Solution Applied ✅
1. **Downgraded React Native to stable version**: `0.73.6`
2. **Set React to stable version**: `18.2.0`
3. **Maintained Expo 53 compatibility**

## Changes Made

### package.json
```diff
- "react": "19.0.0"
- "react-native": "0.79.5"
+ "react": "18.2.0"
+ "react-native": "0.73.6"
```

### Why This Fixes the Crash
- React Native 0.79.5 + React 19 is bleeding edge and unstable for production
- React Native 0.73.6 + React 18.2.0 is LTS (Long Term Support) and stable
- React 19 introduced breaking changes that can cause runtime crashes
- React Native 0.73.6 is fully tested and production-ready

## Verification Steps
1. ✅ Versions downgraded successfully
2. ⏳ Building new APK with stable versions
3. ⏳ Test APK on Android emulator/device

## Commands Used
```bash
npm install react-native@0.73.6 react@18.2.0 --save
npm run build:apk:preview
```

## Expected Result
