# Metro Bundler Compatibility Fix Summary

## Issue
After updating React Native and Expo SDK versions, the Metro bundler had version mismatches causing iOS bundling errors and Expo doctor checks to fail.

## Root Cause
Multiple packages were bringing in incompatible Metro versions:
- Old `babel-preset-expo@13.0.0` was including Metro 0.80.x
- Expo SDK 53 requires Metro 0.82.x for compatibility
- Package lock file was preserving old Metro dependency tree

## Resolution Steps

### 1. Updated babel-preset-expo Version
```json
// Before
"babel-preset-expo": "~13.0.0"

// After
"babel-preset-expo": "~13.2.3"
```

### 2. Updated Metro DevDependencies
```json
"devDependencies": {
  "metro": "^0.82.5",
  "metro-config": "^0.82.5", 
  "metro-resolver": "^0.82.5"
}
```

### 3. Clean Dependency Installation
- Removed `node_modules/` and `package-lock.json`
- Ran `npm install` for clean dependency resolution
- Force updated specific Metro packages when needed

### 4. Verification
```bash
npx expo-doctor
# Result: 15/15 checks passed. No issues detected!
```

## Key Packages Updated
- **babel-preset-expo**: 13.0.0 → 13.2.3
- **metro**: 0.80.12 → 0.82.5
- **metro-config**: 0.80.12 → 0.82.5  
- **metro-resolver**: 0.80.12 → 0.82.5

## Compatibility Matrix
- **React Native**: 0.79.5
- **React**: 19.0.0
- **Expo SDK**: 53
- **Metro**: 0.82.5
- **babel-preset-expo**: 13.2.3

## Status
✅ **RESOLVED**: All Expo compatibility checks passing
✅ Metro bundler version compatibility achieved
✅ iOS bundling errors resolved
✅ Ready for development and builds

## Commands for Reference
```bash
# Check compatibility
npx expo-doctor

# Clean reinstall
